                    <h2>AWS DNS Firewall</h2>
                    <h3>How to prevent data exfiltration via DNS tunneling.</h3>
                    <p>AWS makes several features and services available so that the customer can effectively construct
                        layered security in their environment. However, a few years ago, it was not possible to control
                        DNS
                        queries originating from the VPC natively, so the customer needed to plan the security of their
                        network architecture with third-party solutions in order to fill that gap.[1]</p>
                    <p>
                        Launched in early 2021, Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall is the native solution (managed
                        firewall) that provides the customer with controlling DNS queries made from their environment,
                        enabling the prevention of data exfiltration, reverse shell and other malicious activities
                        through
                        DNS tunneling. In addition, the “DNS Firewall” (we will use this name in this article to
                        reference
                        the official service name) is one of the security controls mentioned by AWS, which adheres to
                        good
                        practices and standards, such as NIST[2] for example.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Route 53 Resolver Overview:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before exploring in practice how to configure DNS Firewall, it is important to remember that
                        queries
                        made within the VPC are forwarded to the Route 53 Resolver or AmazonProvidedDNS (x.x.x.2 of the
                        VPC
                        CIDR).[3]
                    </p>
                    <p>Once Route 53 Resolver receives the query, it can do the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check if the query can be resolved for some resource in the private zone;</li>
                        <li>Check if the query can be resolved for some AWS services;</li>
                        <li>Finally, if none of the two options above matches and there is no forwarding rule, the query
                            is
                            sent to an authoritative DNS on the internet;</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Important to remember:</h3>
                    <p><i>“Route 53 Resolver does not use the Internet Gateway (IGW), Security Groups, or network ACLs
                            attached to your VPC to resolve public DNS zones. That means DNS queries will be resolved
                            even
                            if the VPC does not have an Internet Gateway attached, or a route to the internet.”[4]</i>
                    </p>

                    <h3>DNS Firewall and its components:</h3>
                    <p><b>Rule:</b> A filtering rule for DNS queries in a DNS Firewall rule group. Each rule specifies
                        one
                        domain list and an action to take on DNS queries whose domains match the domain specifications
                        in
                        the list. You can allow, block, or alert on matching queries.</p>
                    <p><b>Domain list:</b> A reusable collection of domain specifications for use in DNS filtering.</p>
                    <p><b>Rule group:</b> A reusable collection of DNS Firewall rules for filtering DNS queries. [5]</p>
                    <h3>Important to remember about DNS Firewall:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does not do name-to-IP resolution;</li>
                        <li>Does not filter HTTPS, SSH, TLS, FTP and etc;</li>
                        <li>Filter only domains and DNS/UDP traffic;</li>
                        <li>Rules are evaluated from lowest priority to highest priority;</li>
                        <li>Capacity of 100 rules per Rule Group;</li>
                        <li>You can associate a rule group with multiple VPCs;</li>
                        <li>Rule groups can be shared between AWS accounts across your organization;</li>
                        <li>DNS Firewall is a Regional service;</li>
                        <li>Logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs, S3 and Kinesis Data Firehose;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Hands-on:</h3>
                    <p>Now that we have an overview of how the services work, let’s create two Domain lists. The domain
                        list
                        <b>“AllDomains”</b> will be used to block all domains, this can be done by using the <b>“*”</b>,
                        as
                        shown in the
                        image below:
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./images/dnsFirewall_images/allPossibleDomains.webp" width="820" height="400"
                            alt="All Possible Domains">
                        <figcaption>Creates a domain list with all possible domains</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The other domain list is <b>“Allowed_Domains”</b>, which will be used in a rule that we will
                        allow
                        queries
                        originating from our VPC to them.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./images/dnsFirewall_images/allowedDomains.webp" width="820" height="400"
                            alt="Allowed Domains List">
                        <figcaption>Creates a domain list with allowed domains</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Done! Now that we have our domain lists, we can go ahead and create the Rule group, add rules to
                        it,
                        and finally, associate the Rule group with the VPC that we want to secure.</p>

                        <figcaption>Creates a Rule and attaches our own domain list with a block action.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Final Results — DNS Firewall:</h3>
                    <p>Without the deployment of DNS Firewall, we can see below that it is possible to perform data
                        exfiltration through DNS queries which come from resources within the VPC.</p>
                    <p>The image shows the log queries that were made to a fictitious malware domain, where the queries
                        were
                        initiated from an EC2 instance. In this case, the data was sent in clear text, but several
                        techniques can be used, such as encoding the data or splitting the queries into several domains
                        as a
                        way to make its identification more difficult.</p>

                        alt="Exfiltration via DNS">
                    <p>Now, when we perform the same query that we have made early, but with our rules adjusted and
                        activated in the DNS Firewall, we can see that the traffic is blocked, which prevents these
                        queries
                        to reach the malicious domain out.</p>

                        alt="Block Exfiltration via DNS">
                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p>To sum up, some companies do not examine nor control their DNS traffic thinking it is inoffensive
                        traffic, trustful or because they do not know the real threats that could be subjected. The
                        reality
                        is that DNS tunneling is not difficult to perform and bad actors know it. If you are using AWS
                        cloud
                        you can take the benefit of DNS Firewall as we saw above and add an additional layer of
                        protection
                        along with other security services, such as GuardDuty and so on.</p>
