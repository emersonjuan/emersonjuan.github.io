                    <h3>How to prevent data exfiltration via DNS tunneling.</h3>
                    <p>AWS makes several features and services available so that the customer can effectively construct
                        layered security in their environment.
                        However, a few years ago, it was not possible to control DNS queries originating from the VPC
                        natively, so the customer needed to plan the security of their network architecture with
                        third-party
                        solutions in order to fill that gap. <br><br><a href="dnsfirewall.html">Continue reading...</a>

                    <p>Today, we will explore the basic concepts of the VPC endpoint for S3, the different types and
                        differences between them, and most importantly, how to configure an S3 endpoint policy to limit
                        which buckets your services can communicate with. <br><br><a href="vpcendpoint.html">Continue

                    <h2>AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)</h2>
                    <p>Service control policies are used as guardrails or to set limits over a central location (AWS
                        Organization). You can use SCPs to define the maximum permission allowed to accounts belonging
                        to
